# Vanilla GCN

This file implemented the most naive version of GCN as described in this paper[https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907] by Thomas Kipf and Max Welling.

The most naive version only require pytorch, though I used pytorch-geometric for loading the dataset.

# GAE&GVAE
This file implemented the graph auto-encoder and graph variational auto-encoder as described in this paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07308.pdf] by Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling.

This implementation used pytorch geometric to load dataset.
